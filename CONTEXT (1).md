## SESSION UPDATE — v2.3 PRODUCTION STABILITY RELEASE
> Date: April 7, 2026
> Status: ✅ LIVE at https://intellicaworkshops.netlify.app
> Previous version: v2.2 (Production Hardened)

### What Was Added/Fixed in v2.3

#### Backend Changes (main.py)
1. **HEAD Handler Added** - Fixed 405 errors from monitoring services (UptimeRobot, Render health checks)
   - Added `@app.head("/")` endpoint returning 200 OK
   - Allows external services to verify backend is alive

2. **OPTIONS Handler Added** - Proper CORS preflight response
   - Added `@app.options("/{rest_of_path:path})` endpoint
   - Returns correct CORS headers for all preflight requests

3. **CORS Configuration Refined** - Explicit allowed origins for local development
   - Added `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:5174`
   - Added `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, `http://127.0.0.1:5174`
   - Added Chromebook Linux container IP support

4. **Version Bumped** - Updated from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0

#### Frontend Changes (App.jsx)
1. **Environment Auto-Detection** - No more manual API URL switching
   - Added `getApiUrl()` function that detects:
     - Netlify production → Render backend
     - localhost → local backend
     - Chromebook IP → Chromebook backend
   - Removed dependency on manual `.env` changes

2. **Trailing Slash Fix** - Fixed double-slash bug (`//analyze`)
   - Added URL sanitization to remove trailing slashes
   - Prevents 404 errors from malformed URLs

3. **Workshop Materials Updated** - New brochure images
   - Changed brochure thumbnail to `AIAB_brchre_thumbnail.png`
   - Changed brochure source to `AIAB_June5th_brochure.png`

## SESSION UPDATE — v2.2 PRODUCTION HARDENING
> Date: april 3rd 2:41pm
> Status: ✅ SECURED & READY FOR STUDENT TRAFFIC

### What Was Added in v2.2

#### Security Hardening (20 min quick-fix)
1. **CORS Lockdown** - Restricted from `["*"]` to specific Netlify domains only
2. **Rate Limiting** - Added slowapi: 10 req/min per endpoint, 100/min per IP
3. **Request Size Limits** - 25MB hard cap with 413 error response
4. **Environment Validation** - Startup check for required API keys
5. **Strict File Validation** - Extension + MIME type checking

#### Production Resilience
1. **Client Retry Logic** - Failed requests retry 3x with exponential backoff
2. **Debouncing** - Prevents concurrent analysis requests
3. **Cold Start Message** - User notification when backend waking up
4. **UptimeRobot** - Pings backend every 10 min (prevents cold starts)

### Free Tier Limits (For 2000 Students)

| Service | Limit | Capacity |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Render** | 100GB bandwidth, 512MB RAM | ⚠️ ~20 concurrent users |
| **Render** | 15 min idle timeout | ✅ Fixed with UptimeRobot |
| **Netlify** | 100GB bandwidth | ✅ 2000+ meetings/month |

**Risk Assessment:**
- ✅ 2000 students over 1 month - bandwidth fine
- ⚠️ 20+ concurrent users - possible slowdowns
- ✅ Cold starts - eliminated by UptimeRobot

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `backend/main.py` | CORS lockdown, rate limiting, size limits, env validation |
| `backend/requirements.txt` | Added slowapi |
| `frontend/src/App.jsx` | Retry logic, debouncing, cold start message |
| `frontend/src/utils/api.js` | New - centralized API with retry logic |

## SESSION UPDATE — v2.0 Recording Bug Fixed, Deployed, Network Error Diagnosed
> Date: april 3rd 2026, 9:35 am
> Status: ✅ Backend deployed, ⚠️ Frontend network error being fixed

### What Was Accomplished This Session

#### 1. Recording Bug Fixed ✅
- **Problem**: Browser recording returned "Only MP3/M4A supported" error
- **Root cause**: 
  - Chromebook Linux container networking
  - Missing file validation in `/transcribe` endpoint
  - Browser MediaRecorder sends WebM files without proper extension handling
- **Fix applied to `backend/main.py`**:
  - Added file extension validation (.mp3, .m4a, .webm)
  - Added content-type detection for WebM files
  - Automatic filename fixing when browser sends no extension
  - Debug logging for troubleshooting
- **Verification**: Recording works locally on Chromebook at http://localhost:5174

#### 2. Chromebook-Specific Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: Linux container uses different IP than localhost
- **Solution**:
  - Identified Linux container IP: `100.115.92.198`
  - Updated frontend `.env` with `VITE_API_URL=http://100.115.92.198:8000`
  - Bound backend to `0.0.0.0:8000` for container access
  - Both services communicating properly on Chromebook
- **Local test confirmed**: Everything works at http://localhost:5174

#### 3. v2.0 Deployment to Render ✅
- **Backend successfully deployed** to: https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com
- **Verified endpoints**:
  - `GET /` → Returns version 2.0.0
  - `GET /docs` → Shows 6 routes (/, /transcribe, /status, /analyze, /draft-email, /coach)
- **Environment variables set**:
  - `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` (32-char string)
  - `GROQ_API_KEY` (starts with gsk_)
- **Deployment status**: Live and responding

#### 4. v2.0 Frontend Deployed to Netlify ⚠️
- **Frontend URL**: https://dancing-gecko-e9a899.netlify.app
- **Issue discovered**: Network error when clicking buttons
- **Likely cause**: Netlify not picking up `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
- **Current status**: Investigating network error

### Current State

| Component | Status | URL |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Backend (v2.0) | ✅ Live | https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com |
| Frontend (v2.0) | ⚠️ Network error | https://dancing-gecko-e9a899.netlify.app |
| Local Backend | ✅ Working | http://100.115.92.198:8000 |
| Local Frontend | ✅ Working | http://localhost:5174 |
| Git Branch | main | Merged and pushed |
| v2.0 Tag | ✅ Created | Tag pushed to GitHub |

### Files Modified This Session

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `backend/main.py` | Added file validation, content-type detection, WebM support, debug logging to `/transcribe` endpoint |
| `frontend/.env` | Updated VITE_API_URL to http://100.115.92.198:8000 for Chromebook local testing |
| `frontend/netlify.toml` | Created for environment variable configuration (optional) |
| `frontend/src/App.jsx` | Verified correct (no changes needed) |

### Open Issues

| # | Problem | Status | Priority |
|---|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Netlify frontend network error | 🔍 Diagnosing | High |
| 2 | `VITE_API_URL` not loading in production | 🔍 Investigating | High |
| 3 | CORS potentially blocking requests | 🔍 Checking | Medium |

### Current Debugging Steps

#### What We've Tried:
1. ✅ Backend deployed and verified working
2. ✅ Frontend deployed to Netlify
3. ✅ Identified network error in browser console
4. ⚠️ Need to check actual error message

#### What We Need to Do:
1. [ ] Open browser console on Netlify site (Ctrl+Shift+J on Chromebook)
2. [ ] Check what `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` returns
3. [ ] Test backend connection with fetch()
4. [ ] Set environment variable in Netlify dashboard
5. [ ] Redeploy frontend with correct config

### Git Commands Executed

```bash
# Commit recording fix
git add backend/main.py
git commit -m "fix: add file validation and WebM support to /transcribe endpoint"
git push origin feature/v2-upgrade

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/v2-upgrade
git push origin main

# Tag v2.0 release
git tag -a v2.0 -m "MeetingMind v2.0 — Production Release"
git push origin v2.0

Deployment Commands Used
Render Backend Deployment:
Manual deploy triggered from Render dashboard

Build successful

Service running at https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com

Netlify Frontend Deployment:
Auto-deploy from GitHub main branch

Build command: npm run build

Publish directory: dist

⚠️ Environment variable not configured in Netlify dashboard

Next Steps to Fix Network Error
Step 1: Diagnose the Error
javascript
// Open browser console on Netlify site (Ctrl+Shift+J)
// Run these commands:

// Check API URL
console.log('API URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL)

// Test backend connection
fetch('https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com/')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Backend response:', data))
  .catch(err => console.error('Backend error:', err))

// Check protocol (must be HTTPS for microphone)
console.log('Protocol:', window.location.protocol)
Step 2: Fix Netlify Environment Variable
Go to https://app.netlify.com

Click site: dancing-gecko-e9a899

Site configuration → Environment variables

Add variable:

Key: VITE_API_URL

Value: https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com

Save

Trigger deploy: Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site

Step 3: Alternative Quick Fix (if Netlify UI doesn't work)
bash
# Create netlify.toml in frontend folder
cd ~/meetingmind/frontend

cat > netlify.toml << 'EOF'
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  VITE_API_URL = "https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com"
EOF

# Commit and push
git add netlify.toml
git commit -m "Add netlify.toml with VITE_API_URL"
git push origin main
Step 4: Test Backend Directly
bash
# In browser, go to:
https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com/
# Should show: {"status":"MeetingMind is running!","version":"2.0.0"}

https://meetingmind-api.onrender.com/docs
# Should show FastAPI documentation with 6 routes
What the Network Error Likely Is
Most probable cause: Netlify doesn't automatically read .env files. You must manually set VITE_API_URL in their dashboard.

Error would look like:

GET http://localhost:8000/transcribe net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

Or VITE_API_URL is undefined

Or Failed to fetch

Fix: Set environment variable in Netlify dashboard and redeploy.

## NEXT SESSION OPENING MESSAGE

"I am continuing MeetingMind. v2.0 frontend is complete and working
except for one open bug: browser recording returns 'Only MP3 and M4A
supported' error. The fix requires knowing what filename the browser
is sending. Add this debug line to the transcribe function in main.py:

print(f"DEBUG received filename: '{filename}'")

## SESSION SUMMARY — WHAT WAS DONE THIS SESSION

### Branch created
- Created feature branch: `feature/v2-upgrade`
- All v2.0 work happens here — main branch untouched and live
- Accidentally pushed to main once (no damage — no code changes had been made yet)
- Confirmed back on feature/v2-upgrade before starting development

### Backend — main.py completely replaced ✅
- v2.0 backend written and saved
- NOT yet deployed to Render — waiting for branch merge
- Verified locally via /docs page

---

## CURRENT STATE

### Branch status
```
* feature/v2-upgrade   ← you are here, all v2.0 work
  main                 ← live app, v1.0, untouched
```

### What is done
- ✅ Step 1.1 — new main.py written and saved
- ✅ Step 1.2 — verified /docs shows 5 routes locally
- ✅ Step 1.3 — committed to feature/v2-upgrade branch
- ✅ Step 1.4 — NOT deployed to Render yet (intentional — waiting for merge)

### What is NOT done yet

- Three distinct writing styles:
  - **ceo** — bullet points, no fluff, under 200 words, outcomes only
  - **client** — warm, relationship-first, commitments not tasks, under 300 words
  - **team** — casual, direct, energetic, uses names, under 250 words
- Also uses open_questions, parking_lot, next_agenda in prompt

### NEW: /coach endpoint
- Input: effectiveness_score, effectiveness_reason, open_questions,
  risk_flags, sentiment, action_items, meeting_type
- Returns:
```json
  {
    "headline": "punchy one-line meeting quality summary",
    "top_strength": "single best thing about the meeting",
    "top_improvement": "single most important change for next time",

## ALL BUGS AND FIXES — CUMULATIVE LIST
### (Additions to v1.0 list)

| # | Problem | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Accidentally pushed to main during branch setup | No damage — no code changes made yet, switched back to feature branch | Git |

---

## INNOVATION FEATURES IN v2.0
### (For workshop and demo narrative)

| Feature | Why it's novel |
|---|---|
| Email tone selector | Same meeting data → 3 completely different emails in one click. No meeting tool does this. |
| Meeting Coach | Prescriptive improvement advice, not just descriptive analysis. Tells you what to do differently next time. |
| Talk time analytics | Calculated free from AssemblyAI timestamps — no extra API cost. Shows who dominates meetings. |
| Demo mode | Zero friction — visitors see full results without uploading anything. Conversion tool. |
| 13-field extraction | Most tools give summary + action items. We give 13 fields including risk flags, key quotes, parking lot. |
| Confidence score | Trust signal. Shows how accurately the AI transcribed. No other free tool surfaces this. |

---

## BACKEND ARCHITECTURE — main.py

Four FastAPI routes:

### GET /
Health check. Returns `{"status": "MeetingMind is running!", "version": "1.0.0"}`

### POST /transcribe
- Input: MP3, M4A, or WebM audio file (multipart upload)
- Validates file extension
- Saves to `/tmp/`
- Submits to AssemblyAI with:
  - `speaker_labels=True`
  - `speech_models=[aai.SpeechModel.universal]`
- Returns: `{ job_id }` immediately — async

### GET /status/{job_id}
- Polls AssemblyAI for job completion
- Returns `{ status: "processing" }` while waiting
- When complete returns:
  - `status: "complete"`
  - `utterances: [{speaker, text, start_ms, end_ms}]`
  - `speakers: ["A", "B"]`
- Frontend polls this every 3 seconds

### POST /analyze
- Input: `{ utterances, speaker_map: {A: "Damian", B: "Sarah"} }`
- Builds clean named transcript from utterances + speaker map
- Sends to Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile
- Uses `response_format: json_object` for reliable JSON
- Extracts: summary, decisions, action_items, key_topics
- Validates all keys present before returning
- Returns structured JSON

### POST /draft-email
- Input: `{ summary, decisions, action_items, key_topics }`
- Sends to Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile
- Returns: `{ email: "plain text email" }`
- Prompt instructions: use only provided data, under 300 words

---

## FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE — App.jsx

### State machine — 6 steps:
```
UPLOAD → PROCESSING → NAME_SPEAKERS → ANALYZING → RESULTS → ERROR
```

### Key state variables:
- `step` — current pipeline step
- `audioFile` — selected file for upload
- `utterances` — array from AssemblyAI
- `speakers` — unique speaker labels ["A", "B"]
- `speakerMap` — { A: "Damian", B: "Sarah" }
- `results` — full extraction JSON
- `email` — drafted email text
- `countdown` — 3..2..1 before browser recording
- `isRecording` — browser recording active
- `recordingTime` — seconds elapsed
- `pollRef` — interval ref for AssemblyAI polling
- `mediaRecorderRef` — browser MediaRecorder ref
- `audioChunksRef` — collected audio chunks

### Page sections (top to bottom):
1. **BANNER** — AIAB_banner.png full width + UWI venue overlay text
2. **ARCHITECTURE** — SVG three-agent pipeline diagram + tech stack badges
3. **WORKSHOP MATERIALS** — brochure card + curriculum PDF card side by side
4. **HERO APP SECTION** — glowing mic icon, Start Meeting CTA, pipeline states
5. **FALLBACK UPLOAD** — file picker for MP3/M4A (shown only on UPLOAD step)
6. **FOOTER** — Intellica AI credit line

### Design tokens:
```javascript
bg:      '#0a0e1a'  // deep dark navy
card:    '#111827'  // dark card background
border:  '#1e3a5f'  // dark blue border
accent:  '#00d4ff'  // electric blue
purple:  '#7c3aed'  // violet
text:    '#f0f4f8'  // near white
muted:   '#8899aa'  // grey
success: '#00e676'  // green
error:   '#ff4d4d'  // red
```

### Key functions:
- `handleStartMeeting()` — triggers 3..2..1 countdown
- `startBrowserRecording()` — requests mic, starts MediaRecorder
- `handleStopRecording()` — stops MediaRecorder, triggers upload
- `uploadAudioFile(file)` — shared upload function for both paths
- `startPolling(job_id)` — polls /status every 3 seconds
- `handleNameConfirm()` — validates speaker names, triggers analysis
- `runAnalysis()` — calls /analyze then /draft-email sequentially
- `copyEmail()` — clipboard copy with 2.5s feedback
- `reset()` — clears all state, returns to UPLOAD step
- `formatTime(seconds)` — MM:SS formatter for recording timer

---

## EVERY BUG AND FIX DISCOVERED IN v1.0 BUILD

These are permanent — do not revert any of them.

| # | Problem | Fix Applied | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Chromebook pip3 blocked by system | Add `--break-system-packages` to all pip3 commands | Terminal |
| 2 | `uvicorn` command not found | Use `python3 -m uvicorn` instead | Terminal |
| 3 | uvicorn can't find main.py | Always `cd ~/meetingmind/backend` before starting | Terminal |
| 4 | AssemblyAI `speech_model` deprecated | Use `speech_models=[aai.SpeechModel.universal]` (plural, list) | main.py |
| 5 | AssemblyAI rejected again | Same fix — plural + list was the correct form | main.py |
| 6 | Groq `llama3-8b-8192` decommissioned | Replace with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` in both routes | main.py |
| 7 | JSX parse error line 345 | `<a>` tag opening was stripped — put all attributes on one line | App.jsx |
| 8 | `label` variable conflict in JSX map | Renamed loop variable from `label` to `spkr` | App.jsx |
| 9 | GitHub push blocked GH013 | Real Groq key accidentally in .env.example commit ed46067 | Git |
| 10 | GitHub fix | Rotated Groq key + used GitHub secret scanning unblock URL | GitHub |
| 11 | Render build failed — dbus-python | requirements.txt had system packages from `pip3 freeze` | requirements.txt |
| 12 | Render fix | Replaced requirements.txt with clean minimal 7-package list | requirements.txt |

## REQUIREMENTS EVOLUTION — KEY DECISIONS MADE

These decisions were made deliberately after discussion — do not revisit without good reason.

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| AssemblyAI for transcription + diarization | Best free diarization, no credit card, 100hrs free |
| Groq for LLM | Completely free forever, no credit card, fast |
| 2 API keys only | Simplicity for workshop — both free, both fast to set up |
| No Anthropic/OpenAI in workshop build | Requires credit card — eliminated for workshop accessibility |
| Phone recording → email → upload | Simpler than browser recording, better audio quality |
| MP3 and M4A only for file upload | Two formats phones export natively |
| WebM accepted for browser recording | Browser MediaRecorder outputs WebM |
| AssemblyAI async + polling | Required — AssemblyAI doesn't respond synchronously |
| Groq json_object mode | Forces clean JSON — near-zero parse failures |
| llama-3.3-70b-versatile | Replaced decommissioned llama3-8b-8192 |
| Speaker naming prompt | User confirms names once — LLM never guesses |
| Dark futuristic theme | Navy/blue/purple — AI/robotic aesthetic |
| React + Vite frontend | More impressive demo than Streamlit or vanilla |
| FastAPI backend | Clean, debuggable, good docs page |
| Render + Netlify deployment | Both free, both reliable |
| Minimal requirements.txt | Full pip freeze caused Render build failure |

All of these are already coded in the updated main.py built during session 1.
Just needs to be pasted in and deployed.

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Expanded extraction | 13 fields: summary, decisions, action_items (with priority), open_questions, parking_lot, key_topics, key_quotes, sentiment, sentiment_reason, effectiveness_score, effectiveness_reason, next_agenda, risk_flags |
| Transcript flattening | Clean named text sent to Groq — not raw JSON utterances |
| punctuate + format_text | AssemblyAI cleans transcript before analysis |
| Talk time calculation | Per speaker: ms, minutes, percentage — from timestamps |
| Confidence score | AssemblyAI confidence passed through to frontend |

### Layer 2 — UX Improvements (Frontend)

| Feature | Detail | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Meeting title + date | Added in results after analysis, pre-fills today's date | Low |
| Collapsible transcript | Full speaker-labeled transcript below results | Low |
| Talk time bar chart | CSS bars per speaker — no library | Low |
| Confidence score badge | Small badge showing transcription quality % | Low |
| Sentiment card | Visual sentiment + effectiveness score display | Low |
| Open questions card | New result card | Low |

| Share via email | mailto link pre-populated with follow-up email | Low |
| Word cloud topics | Styled tag display of key topics | Low |
| Action item priority | High/Medium/Low badge on each action item | Low |

### Layer 3 — Power Features

| Feature | Detail | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Meeting history | localStorage — browse past analyses | Medium |
| Browser recording polish | Start Meeting fully tested on live deployment | Medium |
| Audio quality constraints | echoCancellation, noiseSuppression, 16kHz | Low |
| Render cold start handler | Wake-up ping + message when backend sleeping | Low |
| Export as PDF | Download full minutes as PDF | Medium |
| Slack webhook | Post action items to Slack channel | Medium |

### Layer 4 — Workshop Deliverables (Separate docs)

| Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|
| Replit student build guide | Not started — needed urgently |
| Claude Code student build guide | Not started — further out |

---

## RECOMMENDED v2.0 BUILD ORDER

### Week 1 — High impact, low effort
1. Paste in updated main.py (already written) → push → redeploy Render
